# Pizza Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Streamlit to create a machine learning model that predicts pizza prices based on the pizza diameter. The data is sourced from a CSV file that contains sample data for pizza diameters and their corresponding prices.

Iâ€™m using **Poetry** to manage dependencies and **Pyenv** to handle the Python version for this project.

This is my first project in the world of Machine Learning, and I'm excited to start my journey in this field!


## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and model predictions.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web application for the prediction model.

## Project Overview:
This project is a simple linear regression model trained to predict the price of a pizza based on its diameter. The model is built using a sample dataset in CSV format, which is used to train and test the linear regression algorithm. The project also includes a web interface using Streamlit, where users can input the diameter of a pizza and receive an estimated price based on the trained model.

## Dataset:
The dataset is a simple CSV file (pizzas.csv) with two columns:

diameter: The diameter of the pizza (in inches).
price: The corresponding price of the pizza (in dollars).

## Conclusion:
This project is an introductory step into the world of machine learning and data science. I'm excited to continue exploring and improving my skills in this field. Feel free to explore the project and see how the model works!
